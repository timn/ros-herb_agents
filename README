herb_agents: HERB-specific high-level agents
============================================

This package provides the set of agents initially available for HERB, the
Home Exploring Robot Butler at Intel Labs Pittsburgh.

Although the set of skills might not be immediately useful for other robots,
because if addresses the specific HERB components, it might still serve as a
useful example if you are new to the behavior engine.

The agents must be executed in the environment created by luaagent.
